### Hello!
### [Welcome to my GitHub page.](https://joaosousa1.github.io/)

IT professional, Linux user since 2004, with experience in leveraging the open-source ecosystem to develop efficient and scalable solutions. I have hands-on experience in Machine Learning, with an emphasis on fine-tuning and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). I apply Transfer Learning using models such as YOLOX and RF-DETR, in conjunction with OpenCV for image pre-processing and post-processing. Self-taught, with a strong commitment to continuous learning and to transforming ideas into robust software solutions.

I’m currently in localhost but ready for port foward 🤓.

My name is João Sousa and I am an TI enthusiast who has been using Linux since 2004 🐧 to program, surf the web and play FPS. I am interested in raspberry pi, Linux servers, and all that is open source technology. I like to program for the web with "vanilla" Javascript, CSS and HTML5, but when I need ✨ "super powers" ✨  in the front-end i use Vue.js, React.js or Three.js. In the back-end i like to use Node.js and Mongodb, but also use PHP and MySQL. "Live long and prosper" to PHP 🖖. In creative mode I only use open source tools like Blender, Inkscape, Gimp, Kdenlive, VScode and also know how to close the "VIM" 😂. I am self-taught and have a little knowledge of Java and Godot (GDScript) that I have used in small apps published on Android Google Play.
